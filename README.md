# KERNVER 1-2: SH1MMER:
so first head over to: [CROS.DOWNLOAD](https://cros.download/shims) and download your Chromebook Board name you can find it by heading over to chrome://version.
then after you download your shim (corresponding to your boardname) head over to here: [Wax4Web](https://sh1mmer.me/builder). then it downloads a .bin file, named something like (injected-shim.bin) then you use [Chromebook Recovery Utility](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chromebook-recovery-utili/pocpnlppkickgojjlmhdmidojbmbodfm?hl=en) to flash the injected-shim onto the USB drive. then you press, esc+refesh+power and then hit ctrl+d then press esc+refresh+power again and then plug in your USB drive and then once your in the sh1mmer payload select Unenroll!


# KERNVER 2: CRYPTOSMITE:
so head over to: https://github.com/FWNavy/CryptoSmite/blob/main/cryptosmite.md
and download the stateful.tar.xz and st.tar.xz files.
then use wax4web to get a injected-shim.bin file and then (im not gonna explain again, just do the steps from SH1MMER to flash on the usb and shit like that..) and yeah, you should be unenrolled now!

# KERNVER 2: DAUB:
so head over to: https://dl.snerill.org/Daub then download the shim corresponding to your boardname, then flash onto USB via Chromebook Recovery Utility, then press and hold down the keys: (esc+refresh+power) then plug in your USB drive then just wait. Then you should be unenrolled now! Hooray!

# KERNVER 3: OlyBmmer: so first get a RECOVERY IMAGE, NOT AN RMA SHIM:  [CROS.DOWNLOAD](https://cros.download/recovery)
and download that, afer thats done head over to, the BadRecovery Web Builder: https://binbashbanana.github.io/badrecovery/ and then you'll get a .bin file (then flash the .bin file onto the usb via Chromebook Recovery Utility.) and yeah! you should be unenrolled now!


# KERNVER 4: ICARUS: so i think from my understanding, icarus is a bit different. You gotta unenroll via usb via shim then you spoof with an ip.
So head over to here: https://dl.snerill.org/icarus to get your RMA shim (Corresponding to your Boardname)
So after you unenroll go to WiFi-Settings, then Change the Proxy Type to Manual. And to Host your own proxy here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trqwRNPcVV4
AND AFTER HOSTING ICARUS ON YOUR OWN COMPUTER, MAKE SURE TO THAT After unenrolling change back to direct internet connection in proxy settings

# KERNVER 5: Br0ker:
So first get your Br0ker shim from here: https://github.com/ading2210/sh1mmer/releases/tag/2025.9.19 and btw IGNORE THE ASSETS SECTION. SO first download the RMA shim corresponding to your Boardname and then flash with chromebook recovery utility, then press the keys (esc+refresh+power) then plug in Your USB then just wait, and then yeah your unenrolled after that! (hope you enjoyed my guide!).



## What Kernver and ChromeOS version do I have?
[What Kernver and ChromeOS version do I have?](#what-kernver-and-chromeos-version-do-i-have)

# *(You can find your Kernver version by pressing, esc+refresh+power and pressing Tab, Its the line that reads: tpm_kernver=0x00010004, if it reads that, Then Your Kernver is 4, and for your chromeos version you just have to press, Alt+V on then sign-in screen and you'll see your version.)*


# KERNVER 6: QUICKSILVER:
# so first head over to https://dl.snerill.org/QuickSilver then download the shim, corresponding to your boardname, then unzip the file and flash the .bin file onto your USB and then boot into quicksilver by pressing, esc+refresh+power then plug in/insert your usb and there you go, goodjob!



# KEYROLLED: KERNVER 6: 
There are four methods https://github.com/crosbreaker/baddieapple or https://github.com/crosbreaker/badbr0ker or Visit https://github.com/crosbreaker/badsh1mmer or https://dl.snerill.org/BadSilver and https://github.com/crosbreaker/baddieapple. So First head over to: https://dl.snerill.org/ and select your method. Then after the file is done downloading, unzip the file then flash onto a USB drive, via  [Chromebook Recovery Utility](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chromebook-recovery-utili/pocpnlppkickgojjlmhdmidojbmbodfm). Then press the keys: (esc+refresh+power) then plug in your USB Drive. and then Hooray Your Unenrolled Now!


# Dededeicarus
> [!WARNING]
> DEDEDEICARUS IS ONLY FOR KEYROLLED DEDEDE CHROMEBOOKS IF YOUR CHROMEBOOK IS NOT A DEDEDE BOARD, THEN DEDEDEICARUS IS NOT FOR YOUR CHROMEBOOK
# INSTRUCTIONS ARE ON HERE: https://github.com/crosbreaker/dededeicarus



# What even is Keyrolling?


# So Keyrolling is where newer boardnames, (Like Nissa) are like LOCKED DOWN so you can't just like unenroll without Newer Methods (Like BadSH1mmer) and stuff like that



# And What should I do After Unenrolling?



# ANSWER: I WOULD USE MURKMOD AFTER UNENROLLING SUCCESFULLY BECAUSE MURKMOD SPOOFS THE FACT THAT THE CHROMEBOOK GOT UNENROLLED, BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T USE MURKMOD AFTER UNENROLLING YOUR SYSADMIN WILL PROBABLY FIGURE OUT THAT THE CHROMEBOOK IS UNENROLLED FROM THE GOOGLE ADMIN CONSOLE (MURKMOD LINK: https://github.com/rainestorme/murkmod)

# USB-less Exploits:
# KERNVER 1, REQUIRES ChromeOS v101 and below: SHroot
1. open crosh, (ctrl+alt+t)
2. paste the following in:
3. ```set_cellular_ppp \';dbus-send${IFS}--system${IFS}--print-reply${IFS}--dest=org.chromium.SessionManager${IFS}/org/chromium/SessionManager${IFS}org.chromium.SessionManagerInterface.ClearForcedReEnrollmentVpd;exit;\'```
4. press enter
5. Just like this:

6. <img width="1217" height="216" alt="crosh-rootesc" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ab2be14-337d-468a-bcc6-ee9a950e42f4" />



## ChromeOS v129 and below - BadApple + Icarus
Basically, this abuses both BadApple and Icarus, all without a USB flash drive (unless you need to downgrade). BadApple is an exploit in Ti50/2023+ devices that abuses the Internet Recovery to access a root shell, from which you can use Icarus.
1. Ensure you on on ChromeOS v129 or lower, if you are on KV4, downgrade to a version like v126, if you are on v132, this will not work.
2. Enter recovery using Esc+refresh+Pwr. If you downgraded from ChromeOS v132, go to Options, then select `Internet Recovery (old)`. If you did not downgrade, just select normal `Internet Recovery`.
3. Wait for MiniOS to load, then go through the setup process until you get to Wi-Fi setup. Here you need to login to a Wi-Fi network, and then STOP.
4. Now you press Ctrl+Alt+F3, if it shows a black screen, repeat step 2 but open `Internet Recovery (old)`.
5. On an Android or Linux device, use Termux/Terminal to host Icarus_



## CRSH2TTY: All versions (PATCHED!)
CRSH2TTY has been patched! It will no longer work for ANY Chromebook because it was a server-side bug. The steps remain below for archival purposes.

CRSH2TTY is a very funny exploit. It's a cool universal USB-less exploit that should not even work at all yet it has been tested on many devices, including new ones like `nissa craaskbowl` or `dedede boten` to extremely old ones like `peppy` or `clapper`. No one is exactly sure how this works, but it requires two 2-second waits and then one 15-hour wait to work.

1. Powerwash using `ctrl+shift+q+q` and then `ctrl+alt+shift+r`. If this doesn't work, press `esc+⟳+⏻ ` (`esc+refresh+power`) and then `ctrl+d`, and then `enter`.
2. Proceed through ChromeOS setup as normal.
3. When it starts to enroll, wait 2 seconds then restart by preforming an EC reset by pressing `⟳+⏻ ` (`refresh+power`).
4. When it starts to enroll again, wait 2 seconds and press the recovery shortcut, `esc+⟳+⏻ ` (`esc+refresh+power`) then `⏻ ` (`power`) to turn it off.
5. Leave it off for ***15 hours*** or more.
6. Once 15 hours is up, turn on the Chromebook. You should be greeted at the `Welcome to your Chromebook` screen, you should already be connected to Wi-Fi, so press `Get started`.
7. On the `Get connected` screen, just press `Next`, you should see `Getting your device ready`, wait on this screen, and then you should see `Choose your Chromebook's setup`. 
9. Hooray!!!
